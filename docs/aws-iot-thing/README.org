- *Set thing.crt*. Copy the downloaded file (named something like =abcdefg-certificate.pem.crt=) to
  =mqtt_clients/aws_iot_thing/certs= as =thing.crt=.

- *Set thing.key*. Obtain the private key for the Thing from the deployment state file or the
  secrets manager.

- (Optional) Open =mqtt_clients/shared/mock_data.py= and update the =_generate_event_payload= method.
  You can add or update keys with values, as per requirement.

- Run the simulator with the following command:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  python -m mqtt_clients.main \
      -f json \
      -e abcdefgh12345.iot.your-region.amazonaws.com \
      -n simulator \
      -t 'topic/to/publish/' \
      -w 10
  #+END_SRC

/See the `__init__.py` of the chosen client for more info about the above options./
